# Attention

One important property of human perception is that one does not tend to process a whole scenein its entirety at once.  Instead humans focus attention selectively on parts of the visual space toacquire information when and where it is needed, and combine information from different fixationsover time to build up an internal representation of the scene, guiding future eye movementsand decision making.

Attention was initially designed in the context of Neural Machine Translation using Seq2Seq Models.

Attention takes 2 sentences and turns them into a matrix.
The words of the first sentence for the columns, the words of the second sentence form the rows. Then it makes matches, identifying relevant context.
